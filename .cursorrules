NodeJS React TypeScript
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Remix, Vitest, CI, Github.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- When a significant piece of changes looks working, suggest to git commit with a descriptive message.
- Don't store secrets and keys in code, organize into environment–specific configuration files.
- Update README.md with key points so it's clear for anyone how to quickly start project.
- Follow semantic versioning.

Running commands
- Use Makefile over package.json to organize commands. Use make commands in package.json "scripts" section.
- Maintain Makefile to always have a command to install system dependencies and run the project in development mode locally.
- Run CLI commands and check the output. Fix whenever it's possible. 

Runtime tooling
- Use nvm or asdf based on which version file is in the project.
- When NodeJS version allows, use built–in TypeScript support when running scripts in development.

Repo and monorepo organization
- Use the latest yarn v4 if possible. Fall back to v3 if v4 is not compatible.

Tests
- Use Vitest over Jest.

Continuous integration
- Prefer Github actions that are run on PRs to `main` branch
